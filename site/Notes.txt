$ git clone LINK OF YOUR GIT PAGE
#makes a copy of the git page/s on your local machine



$ git checkout branchname (eg gh-pages in our case)
# changes the branch to the specified one (i.e gh-pages)
C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project\site>git status
#This command gives the status of your git page (eg what is extra on your device vs what is on your github repository)


On branch gh-pages
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/gh-pages'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ./ 	(uncommited parent folders (denoted by "./") will be shown in RED till you reach the last parent directory that was commited)

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
#This message is given when your current working directory (denoted by './') is not commited or linked with your github repo




#Whenever you create a new folder/file locally; use "C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project>git add ."
# "." is used to mark everthing that is still uncommitted (in our case only "site")
#you can also particularly mark what you wanna commit (eg git add site)



C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project>git status
On branch gh-pages
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/gh-pages'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   site/index.html    (in the last commited parent directory, everything uncommitted will be shown in GREEN)

	(OR	modified:	filename or foldername) 

#These are the files/folders that are marked to be committed 
#it could be a "new file" or "modified file"



C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project>git config --global user.email "aymens1991@gmail.com"

C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project>git config --global user.name "Aymen"
#these are commands used to authorize your github account and Author name



C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project>git commit -m "My First Page"
[gh-pages b398c68] My First Page
 1 file changed, 9 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 site/index.html
#once the files are marked and your github is linked, use this command to commit changes
#"-m" is used to give a custom message(My First Page) when you execute the command to show yourself what is happening(not mandatory)



C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project>git push
#once you have commited changes locally, this command is used to commit changes remotely(i.e on your Github repo)



#Browser-sync is used to live sync your files. (i.e. once you save on your pc, your website gets updated without needing to be refreshed)



#C:\Users\Aymen\Desktop\Git Project\personal-project\site>browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*"
#This command starts browser-sync in server mode (i.e. your pc is the server) from the current directory (i.e. "site") select files with "name" (we used name as "*" which means all files in current directory)



"git add,commit and push" MUST BE DONE AFTER EVERY CHANGE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THEM IN YOUR REPO(You can also commit multiple changes at once)
(NOT NEEDED if using browser-sync)
