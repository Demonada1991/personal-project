HTML - HyperText Markup Language
	>provides structure to your webpage
	>shows what components are in your webpage
	
	>HyperText because one text links to another text and so on. Sometimes the final link may again link to the first text.
	>HyperMedia includes media. It is upgraded HyperText 
	(all the playables i.e audio,video,etc)

	>Markup Because the it provides tags which speak what the the text in your webpage is 
	(eg <title>Something</title> will tell you that "Something" is the title of your webpage)

	>Language because it is something that is understandable by a community (i.e web devs know what you are doing)


CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
	>Provides the style (colors,layout,font style,etc) to the components of your webpage


Javascript - >provides functionality (behaviour) to the
	webpage
	>eg what happens when clicking something, what happens when pages load etc.


HTML tags - <+element(eg p,head,body,etc)+> together form a tag
			( <element> )
		<p attribute name="value" or attributename = "value  "> are same as spaces don't matter
		BUT THERE SHOULD BE NO SPACE BETWEEN '<' AND THE ELEMENT i.e. '<p' however there is no annonation to be followed for closing it (i.e <p> or <p > are the same)
		BUT CLOSING TAGS MUST BE ONE SINGLE ELEMENT (eg </p>)

		>Use "" or '' to specify attribute values.(not compulsory but good for understanding purpose)

		HTML tags are case insensitive



format of HTML document-(NOTE HTML ALWAYS GETS INTERPRETED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM)

<!doctype html>		(Not necessary. Only used to distinguish between compliant and non compliant pages i.e. your browser will know that it is a html page, if not used then it treats as your page DOESN'T follow html standard and BROWSER WILL INTERPRET IN "QUIRKS" MODE)
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">		(standalone tag. Not mandatory. Used for specifying metadata)
		Content (usually title,etc)
		<title>		
				(Compulsory tag)
		</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Content (the main body)
	</body>
</html>
